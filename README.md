#  Credit Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Overview

This project analyzes credit-related customer data and builds machine learning models to predict credit risk / approval outcomes. It follows a complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, scaling, model training, and performance comparison.
The goal is to identify the most effective algorithm for credit prediction based on evaluation metrics.

##  Objective

* Analyze credit dataset features
* Clean and preprocess raw data
* Engineer and transform features
* Train multiple ML models
* Compare model performance
* Select the best performing model

##  Workflow

* Importing libraries
* Data loading and inspection
* Data cleaning
* Feature engineering
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Feature scaling
* Train–test split
* Model training (3 algorithms)
* Evaluation & comparison
* Confusion matrix analysis

##  Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Naive Bayes

##  Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall

##  Tech Stack

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib / seaborn
* scikit-learn

## How to Run ?

git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <repo-folder>
open credit_mini_project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook (make sure project and notebook should be in same folder)
run all cells
